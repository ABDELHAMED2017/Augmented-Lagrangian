# Augmented-Lagrangian
Image In-Painting and Denoising with Augmented Lagrangian

Rusu Project 3 Report contains a description of the algorithm and code

Hw3_Q1.m contains the augmented lagrangian for the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi model

Hw3_Q2.m contains the augmented lagrangian for the in-painting problem

Hw3_Q2.m contains the agumented lagrangian for the compressed sensing problem

All the rest are helper functions.
